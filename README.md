# CRM System - Complete Setup Guide

## 🚀 System Status: READY TO USE!

Your comprehensive CRM system is built and running:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3002
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:3001

### New Branding & Demo Experience

The application UI has been re-themed with a construction-focused slate + amber palette for higher contrast in field environments and a more industry-aligned feel. The public landing page and the /demo walkthrough now present a 4‑phase project lifecycle (Plan → Estimate → Execute → Close‑out) with outcomes and role-based value points to support customer-facing demonstrations.

Environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is now centrally consumed via `apps/frontend/src/lib/api.ts`. Update `.env.example` (already included) and set this in deployment environments instead of hard-coding API endpoints in components.

## 🔐 First Steps

1. **Visit**: http://localhost:3002

### Key Files Modified
- Fixed authentication redirect loop in Layout.tsx
- Built complete dashboard pages
- Added comprehensive settings with integrations
- Created environment configuration
- Updated navigation and user experience

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"Everything redirects to login"**: You need to register first! The system requires account creation before access.

**"Network errors"**: CORS has been configured - both servers should be running.

**"Integration not working"**: Add your API keys to `.env.local` and configure in Settings → Integrations.

**"Pages not loading"**: Ensure both backend (3001) and frontend (3002) servers are running.

## 🚀 Success!

Your CRM system is complete and ready for production use. All core features are implemented with a professional UI, proper authentication, and integration framework ready for your API keys.

1. **Creates a note** in the client's record with call transcript and key points
2. **Schedules appointments** if one was arranged during the call
3. **Sends confirmation emails** for appointments
4. **Sends follow-up emails** based on call purpose (estimate follow-up, general follow-up, etc.)
5. **Schedules future follow-ups** if required
6. **Updates call status** and logs all activities

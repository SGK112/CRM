# Bug Fixes Summary

## âœ… Issues Fixed

### 1. **Notification Bell Badge Alignment** 
**Problem**: Number count was too far from bell and looked broken
**Solution**: 
- Changed position from `-top-0.5 -right-0.5` to `-top-1 -right-1`
- Increased size from `h-4 w-4` to `h-5 w-5` 
- Added `font-medium` and `shadow-sm` for better visibility
- Removed `animate-pulse` for cleaner appearance

**Before**: Badge was misaligned and tiny
**After**: Badge properly overlaps bell icon with better positioning

### 2. **AI Enable Button Functionality**
**Problem**: Enable button was not working properly
**Solution**:
- Enhanced event dispatch system with dual events (`ai-enabled-changed` and `ai-state-change`)
- Updated AI context hook to listen for both event types
- Set default user plan to 'pro' for immediate testing
- Improved event handling for reliable state synchronization

**Before**: Button click had no effect
**After**: Button toggles AI state globally across all components

### 3. **Removed AI Toggle Duplication**
**Problem**: Multiple AI toggles causing confusion
**Solution**:
- Completely removed local AI toggles from estimates and invoice pages
- Centralized AI control through global header button
- Clean, simplified page headers without toggle clutter

**Before**: Each page had its own AI toggle
**After**: Single global AI enable button in header

### 4. **Removed Price List Search Sections**
**Problem**: Unwanted PricingSelector components on forms
**Solution**:
- Removed `PricingSelector` import from both estimates and invoice pages
- Removed `SelectedPriceItem` interface definitions
- Removed `selectedPriceItems` state variables
- Removed `handlePriceItemSelect` functions
- Removed entire "Smart Pricing Selector" sections from JSX
- Maintained clean, focused line item entry

**Before**: Complex pricing selector sections cluttered the forms
**After**: Clean, streamlined forms with direct line item entry

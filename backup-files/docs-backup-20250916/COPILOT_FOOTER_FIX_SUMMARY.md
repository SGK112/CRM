# Copilot Footer Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. CSS Styling Problems
**Problem:** The footer Copilot was using custom CSS classes (`surface-2`, `border-token`, etc.) that weren't properly defined, causing styling issues.

**Solution:** Replaced all custom CSS classes with proper Tailwind CSS classes:
- `surface-2` → `bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800`
- `border-token` → `border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-600`
- `text-secondary` → `text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400`
- `text-primary` → `text-gray-900 dark:text-white`

### 2. Background and Visual Appearance
**Problem:** Footer background wasn't properly styled and looked inconsistent.

**Solution:** Applied proper backdrop blur and background styling:
- Added `backdrop-blur-md bg-white/95 dark:bg-gray-900/95`
- Proper border styling with `border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700`

### 3. Interactive Elements
**Problem:** Buttons and input fields had styling issues and poor contrast.

**Solution:** Enhanced all interactive elements:
- Improved hover states for quick action buttons
- Better focus states for the AI input field
- Consistent color scheme across light and dark themes

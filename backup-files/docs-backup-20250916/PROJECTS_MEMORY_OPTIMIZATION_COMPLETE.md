  - `ProjectStatsCard` - Optimized stats display with color coding
  - `ProjectCard` - Individual project cards with action handlers
  - `LoadingState`, `ErrorState`, `EmptyState` - Proper state management
  - All components use `React.memo()` to prevent unnecessary re-renders

#### 3. Optimized Form Management
- **`ProjectForm` Component** (`/components/ProjectForm.tsx`)
  - Controlled form state with validation
  - Memoized event handlers to prevent re-renders
  - Proper loading states and error handling
  - Modal-based design with accessibility features
  - Production-ready form validation and submission

#### 4. Enhanced Main Page
- **Main Projects Page** (`/page.tsx`)
  - Completely rewritten for optimal performance
  - Uses custom hooks for all data operations
  - Memoized stats calculations and filtered results
  - Proper loading and error state management
  - Responsive design with modern UI patterns

#### 5. Optimized Project Details
- **Project Details Page** (`/[id]/page.tsx`)
  - Memory-optimized with memoized callbacks
  - Efficient data fetching and state management
  - Related data loading (estimates, invoices)
  - Quick action buttons for workflow efficiency
  - Professional design with proper information hierarchy

### ðŸŽ¯ Production-Ready Features

### ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

#### File Structure
```
/dashboard/projects/
â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx                    # Main projects listing (optimized)
â”œâ”€â”€ page-original.tsx          # Backup of original implementation
â”œâ”€â”€ page-optimized.tsx         # Development version
â”œâ”€â”€ [id]/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx               # Project details (optimized)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ page-original.tsx      # Backup of original implementation
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ useProjects.ts         # Custom hook for state management
â””â”€â”€ components/
    â”œâ”€â”€ ProjectComponents.tsx   # Memoized UI components
    â””â”€â”€ ProjectForm.tsx        # Optimized form component
```

#### Key Performance Metrics
